# Excel_Retail_Analytics_Dashboard
This is my first Excel project which I've worked behalf of Ivy professhional school ,I have used this Retail sales dataset to make a valuable report in different region.I have used Excel functions like Pivot tables,charts,vlookup,KPI cards and slicers to create a insightful project on overall profit trend over time, overall profit margin,various discounts across different regions, monthly sales trend for each category and top cities by sales contribution. According to this insights I have got that Kanyakumari has the highest sales contribution across all the cities and the central region gave the highest amount of discounts of products compared to any other regions.
